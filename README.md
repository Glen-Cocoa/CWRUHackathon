This application provides an interface to easily send emergency request messages for opioid overdoses

##About
43,982 drug overdose deaths occurred in 2013 across the nation. Thatâ€™s two times the amount of overdose deaths a decade ago. Opioids are depressants, which means that they slow breathing and heart rate. When a person has an overdose, they have a higher risk of respiratory failure which could lead to coma, permanent brain damage or death. 

We created an app called E.A.R.L (Emergency Action Request Locator) which would notify people in the local area when a person near them has overdosed or has experienced a medical emergency. As a result, responders would be able to aid the person who is experiencing the problem when they are unable to help themselves.

##Login
When the user opens the slide, this would appear on their screen. They would have to log in or sign up and by doing so, they are allowing their phone to be tracked in case of an emergency and are agreeing to receive notifications when others are in need of help.
