## About
43,982 drug overdose deaths occurred in 2013 across the nation. That’s two times the amount of overdose deaths a decade ago. Opioids are depressants, which means that they slow breathing and heart rate. When a person has an overdose, they have a higher risk of respiratory failure which could lead to coma, permanent brain damage or death. 

We created an app called E.A.R.L (Emergency Action Request Locator) which would notify people in the local area when a person near them has overdosed or has experienced a medical emergency. As a result, responders would be able to aid the person who is experiencing the problem when they are unable to help themselves.

## Login
When the user opens the slide, A login would appear on their screen. They would have to log in or sign up and by doing so, they are allowing their phone to be tracked in case of an emergency and are agreeing to receive notifications when others are in need of help.

## Menu
The menu allows users to have access to instructional slides, which show the users how to use the app. The about tab gives information on E.A.R.L and the purpose of the app. The map is shows responders the location of those who need help. The resources tab gives information on drug overdose and what the user can do to help. It also has links that would redirect the user to more detailed information.

## SOS
After a user has signed up or logged in, they would see a SOS button in the middle of their screen. This button is large and accessible to ensure that those who are incapable of calling for help can receive aid with a click of a button. Once this button is clicked, an Emergency Action Request (or EAR) would be sent out to people who have this app in the local area, who would then receive notifications alerting them of an overdose and the location. 

## Responder
If a person can respond to the person who needs help, then they would get transferred to google maps, where they would get the location of the person in need of aid. Underneath that, there would be information on how to administer basic medical needs so the responder is prepared to help the caller. For example, it would give instructions on how to perform respiratory breathing- tilt the head, lift the chin, and pinch the nose, seal their lips and give two quick breaths into their mouth. Then give one long breath every five seconds.


When the responder replies to the notification, the border of the caller’s screen would turn green so the caller knows that someone is on the way. There would be a timer in the middle of the screen notifying the caller of the approximate time it would take the responder to get to their location. There would be key notes telling the caller of anything they can do to survive while they wait for the responder. When a responder gets to the caller’s location, they can press cancel so other people in the area know not to come.
